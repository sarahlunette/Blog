04/28:  Powered by AI: Beyond Human-Machine Collaboration at Engie Auditorium
The place is really nice, people attend with much care and the Engie building is in a part of La Défense that is not to be disregarded. We arrived, early,
my daughter (very yound data scientist who wants to be a doctor) and I to get into a white leather seats auditorium. 
The speakers where many, but one touched societal subjects:
- In history, there are not many times the possibility for Renaissance and AI opportunities are one of a kind that can enables this now.
- We should not miss the step and there is a big question around sovereignty.
- AI Products carry values that are from their origins and this revolution will be about people and values
- There might be a change of paradygm in the way we see the market. From technology-powered, the market will become people-powered.
This great speaker is named Léa Peersman CEO at Lign.
