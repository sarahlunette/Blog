        After this long conversation, I had another point of view on the matter. This is a very exciting moment for the field and I would be very happy to be part of it. In any case, the realm of possibilities and improvements is huge and the need to keep technology close to the human is even greater in this area. I might have sometimes dropped the sense of where the data comes from, what they represent, what consequences could GenAI have on the workers, on the minds, on the work conditions, on the future overall, to come back to do you know what you are doing? Is positivism a good option? Obsolete questions, organisations have a very good sense and want to benefit from any pierce through in technology they could to better peoples' lives, right? Measuring the risk of course.
