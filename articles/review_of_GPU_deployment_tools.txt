None is giving up free good ressources it seems:
- Google Colab Free / Pro (though GPU time is limited).

- Paperspace (Free Tier) offers a great environment for hosting models on GPUs.

- RunPod or Vast.ai can also be used for free with some limitations.

- kaggle does not support continuous services such as API
